Had first phone interview. Sounds promising so far; I think I'm a good match for either position and the money and benefits sound great

at least one more interview with them, have been blanketing downtown #toronto with resumes. Need UNIX geek? PDF resume: http://is.gd/ki9s

Just searched google for 'sxsw 2009' and foo.ca comes up on the front page. Weird how that works. #sxsw2009

Nothing like a REALLY good interview to make you feel good. Also nothing like it to make you feel paranoid about HOW positive it was....

I had someone who claimed to be @tedlarsen thrown out of the building today. I think it was just some thieves casing the joint.

Best job ad today says "Salary: $130K US Base salary rage plus generous bonus" - sadly I'm not qualified and I have plenty of rage already.

Solid interview with bank, excellent fit, relaxed but professional hiring managers... let's see if they call back.

20090501 

It's nice when the interviews I think went well actually did go well enough to get a followup interview... Round two next week.

After speaking with hiring manager, booked phone  interviews two AND three for next week

20090505 

I do like it when the language from interviewers changes from "if we hire you" mode to something more like "when we hire you"

Genius. Not Genious. Fucking Genius.

There are meetings booked for next friday in Toronto, travel plans to follow. Pantless telephone interviews may work, but not so in-person.

20090519

Some old guy waved his hand at me and said "may you live in interesting times" ... I thought nothing of it at the time..

The tentative plan is fly out Thurs afternoon, stay at the Royal York right next door to where I'll be all day Friday, back Fri night.

Okay, I have a boarding pass and hotel information. Much more real now.

20090521

Arrive early for airport "express" which doesn't show anywhere close to schedule time. Share cab with 3 other stranded souls.

In YHZ I was listening to a pair of Never Been Away talk about why the flight to TO was so much faster than the return.

I have a morning filled with interviews for a company that flew me in. This is big, and I'm concerned they will expose me as a fraud

To be clear, I believe this job is a good fit for me, and the people I have spoken to on the phone sound great. Irrational fears are fun.

Up and dressed. Checked out and stowed bag with bell desk... Having coffee and feeling under dressed in to's financial district.

Going well, there are apparently only two candidates but sounds like there may be enough work and space for two...

All done... Long day, great people. Don't think I embarassed myself. Need ipod charger...

Pleasant lunch meeting with hiring mgr really good w/ steak and veggies and creme brulee not fine dining but quite good for $18 entree

Too funny Chi Pig watches me walk up, squees and runs over to give me a hug. How punk rock

Soft job offer in works & won a set of fantasy books thanks to link from @torbooks. Buying lotto ticket on way to office.

Gone over offer ahead of formal letter. Good base good bonus up in air on start date. Too soon is a good be...

20090609 

Sent email in response to soft offer with start date July 13 and a 3% push on the salary offer. Reasonable, but still hyperventilating a bit

Start date is a go, slight salary bump okayed, formal letter on its way. Starting ebay listings... wheeeeee

Talking to HR is a great way to spread news throughout an organization.

Did I mention where the new job is? RBC in their Risk IT dept... not sure on the specific title or division.

20090615

I think I may have solved the moving vehicle crisis. $1200 for a week w/ Dodge Caravan w/ the fold into the floor seats. Better than UHaul

20090625

Last day of work in Halifax. Wheeeeeee!

So it begins. With a bit of luck we will say hello and goodbye to New Brunswick in the next 6 hours.

Been a long 10 days since Toronto has given me something for nothing. I think I just got Psychedelic Furs tickets from @nowcontest

Had a little dog lost, but kind neighbour Suba found her. She explained that she borrowed a leash from another tenant, and they were planning to put up posters and knock on all the doors to try to find her owners. She knocked on doors and we must have mis
